# Data Detective: Cruise Ship Investigation 🚢

Dive into a real-world-inspired scenario: a theft has occurred aboard a luxurious cruise ship, and you’re tasked with cracking the case. Using Python, you’ll analyze a rich dataset including passenger details, card access logs, and dining records to identify the culprit. This hands-on exercise tests your ability to manipulate data, uncover patterns, and draw logical conclusions—skills essential for technical interviews. Imagine yourself as a data detective, sifting through clues like a passenger’s whereabouts or suspicious dining habits, all while leveraging Python’s powerful data-handling capabilities. Perfect for students and job seekers, this challenge offers a practical, story-driven way to prepare for roles requiring analytical prowess and coding expertise. Can you solve the mystery and prove your data analysis chops?

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains an interactive data analysis challenge designed to test candidates' ability to:
- Work with multiple data sources (CSV, JSON)
- Clean and process temporal data
- Perform anomaly detection
- Cross-reference and analyze suspicious patterns
- Draw conclusions from data analysis

## 📝 Challenge Structure

The challenge is divided into 5 progressive tasks:
1. Data Loading & Initial Inspection
2. Timeline Establishment
3. Anomaly Detection
4. Location Analysis 
5. Final Suspect Analysis

Each task builds upon the previous ones, gradually constructing the investigation.

## 💡 Getting Help

If you get stuck:
1. Check `hint_doc.py` for progressive hints
2. Each hint provides incremental guidance without giving away the solution
3. Make sure to attempt each task before looking at hints

## 🌟 Best Practices

- Document your analysis steps
- Include explanations for your findings
- Print intermediate results to verify your analysis
- Consider edge cases in your investigation
- Think about real-world implications of the patterns you find

## 📊 Sample Data Format

The repository includes three data files:
- `passenger_manifest.csv`: Passenger details
- `card_access_logs.json`: Key card access records
- `dining_transactions.csv`: Dining hall purchase records
